this is a WIP fork of NowiChat to (probably) look more like and behave like a messaging app

There's NO guarantee I'll keep this codebase so use at own discretion (I might decide to move on at one point)

Added:
1. Messaging looks more like messaging (right/left chats for devices)
2. Discovery fixes
3. Device name fixes
4. Search box
5. Disconnect button at the top

Todo:
1. File/Photo sending
2. Better persistent background service
3. Better notifications
4. Sent/Read receipts (optional)

FAQ:

- Why?

Most open source bluetooth messaging apps are either very [out of date](https://github.com/imefarhan/Bluetooth-Chat), [haven't](https://github.com/halilozel1903/AndroidBluetoothChatApp) [been](https://github.com/glodanif/BluetoothChat) [updated](https://github.com/atilag/BluetoothLEChat) [for](https://github.com/i-am-mani/Android-Kotlin-Bluetooth-Chat-App) [years](https://github.com/webianks/BluetoothChat) (or [over](https://github.com/onlyinamerica/blemeshchat) a [decade](https://github.com/n8fr8/gilgamesh)) or just [abandoned](https://github.com/sDevPrem/bluetooth-chat-mvvm) and broken on modern devices. [[source](https://www.google.com/search?q=bluetooth+chat+android+site:github.com)]. Closed source apps also either haven't been updated or need payment and not meant for total offline use.
