this is a WIP fork of NowiChat to (probably) look more like and behave like a messaging app

---
why?

most bluetooth messaging apps are either very [out of date](https://github.com/imefarhan/Bluetooth-Chat), [haven't](https://github.com/halilozel1903/AndroidBluetoothChatApp) [been](https://github.com/glodanif/BluetoothChat) [updated](https://github.com/atilag/BluetoothLEChat) for [years](https://github.com/webianks/BluetoothChat) (or over a [decade](https://github.com/n8fr8/gilgamesh)) or just [abandoned](https://github.com/sDevPrem/bluetooth-chat-mvvm) and broken.

there's NO guarantee I'll keep this codebase so use at own discretion (I might decide to move on at one point)

I have multiple devices from various ages I would like to see how modern I can develop a bluetooth chatting app for

added:
1. Messaging looks more like messaging (right/left chats for devices)
2. Discovery fixes
3. Device name fixes
4. Search box
5. Disconnect button at the top
