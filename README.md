this is a WIP fork of NowiChat to (probably) look more like and behave like a messaging app

there's NO guarantee I'll keep this codebase so use at own discretion (I might decide to move on at one point)

I have multiple devices from various ages I would like to see how modern I can develop a bluetooth chatting app for

added:
1. Messaging looks more like messaging (right/left chats for devices)
2. Discovery fixes
3. Device name fixes
4. Search box
5. Disconnect button at the top
